# Student Management App

A simple React-based application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records stored in a local JSON server. The app uses React state management, controlled forms, Fetch API for data interaction, custom hooks for reusable logic, and navigation using React Router.

##  Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, view, edit, and delete student records.
- **State Management**: Manage student data using React's `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Controlled Forms**: Use controlled components for form handling.
- **Navigation**: Navigate between views (e.g., Home, Add, Edit) using React Router.
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic for fetching and updating data via the Fetch API.
- **Local JSON Server**: Simulate a backend API with a local JSON server.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/njuneidi/student-management-app.git
   cd student-management-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up JSON Server**:
   - Start the JSON server to simulate the backend:
     ```
     npm run server
     ```
   - The JSON server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   In a new terminal, start the React development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   - The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if specified).

##  API Endpoints

The JSON server provides the following endpoints:

- **GET `/students`**: Retrieve all student records.
- **POST `/students`**: Add a new student record.
- **PUT `/students/:id`**: Update an existing student record.
- **DELETE `/students/:id`**: Delete a student record.

Example JSON structure:
```json
{
  "students": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 22, "grade": "B" }
  ]
}
```
